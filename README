--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Separation:

  - separation will do a separation after the integration if given an
    output file. There is also an argument to set the random number seed.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nbody:

  - Simulations are described with Lua input files which can be used
  to produce an arbitrary initial configuration of particles.

  - Various options are available for applying external potentials
  to a system.

  - Graphics can be run separately and attach to existing simulations,
  or can be launched at the same time with the --visualizer argument
  to the main process.

  - N-body videos can be produced by using a separate program to
  record OpenGL. A wrapper script that uses this can be used as
  the --visualizer-bin argument to record a video of the
  visualization. An example script is at tools/RecordNBodyVideo.sh



  - Consistent N-body results between different systems require crlibm
  and SSE2 (at least on x86, not sure about other architectures)

  - Returning nil from makePotential() for N-body will run the
    simulation without an external potential

  - Device information is exposed to the workunit through the
    deviceInfo table if it is used.

Tests can be run by running:
  $ make test

  However this runs all of the tests, which takes forever. You can run
  (from the tests directory) some core functionality tests with:
  $ make check

  Other tests  can be run with a certain number of bodies depending on
  how long you want to wait with:

  $ make test_${n}

  Currently n = 100, 1024, 10000 are available.

Random notes:

 - All give usage with --help/-? arguments

make nbody_release and make separation_release will produce release
tarballs if git and xz are installed and found.

- Make sure when building with MSVC to set built to use Multithreaded
  (/MT) for the builds of the various libraries
