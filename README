Build instructions:

basic build:
    $ cmake path/to/source
    $ make

Tests can be run with:
    $ make check

Default build type is release. To enable debugging
    $ cmake /path/to/source -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

Pieces which are buildable based on the dependencies found will be
built.


Notes:

On OS X, Apple's gcc is required since macports gcc seems to not work
when you try linking against frameworks. Note you need to delete
CMakeCache.txt when you change compilers. I'm trying to take care of
this automatically but it only sort of works. Specify the Apple gcc
with -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc, for it's usual location.
