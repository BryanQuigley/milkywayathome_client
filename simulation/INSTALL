In addition to the system-specific instructions below, a copy of the
SimpleDirectMedia Library (SDL) is needed to compile any of the code.

This may be obtained here:
    http://www.libsdl.org/

Windows:

    MinGW:

        install msysgit:
                https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/MSysGit:InstallMSysGit

        to get libraries such as editors refer to the MSYS and MinGW
            repository:

        Alternative GUI-based C/C++ editor - Notepad++
            -has tab-size control
            -allows changing indentation on highlighted blocks of text (shift
                tab reduces indent while tab increases)
            -able to translate unix-style and windows-style carriage returns
            -allows auto-indenting of entire file of code by clicking: TextFX
                ->TextFX Edit->Reindent C++ Code
            -many other popular features

            Notepad++ suggested configuration:

                Make sure indentation matches the code in MilkyWay@Home (auto
                    indent can be reconfigured to match any standard, but to
                    keep things simple it can be turned off):

                    settings->preferences
                        misc->auto-indent - uncheck
                        language menu/tab settings->tab settings->c - uncheck
                            'use default value', 'tab size' should be 4, check
                            'replace by space'
                        new document/default directory->format - select 'unix'

                Make sure trailing whitespace is removed on saving to avoid
                    merging problems with git:

                    settings->shortcut mapper->
                        main menu->save (right click)->modify - uncheck all
                            and change to 'none'
                        macros->trim trailing and save (right click)->modify
                            - uncheck all but ctrl, 's' should be selected

        Build instructions:

            ./smakeall

        Note: a formal make file will replace the above shell script in upcoming revisions.

Mac:

    Build needs testing and a make file, however all libraries should be compatible.

Linux:

    Build needs testing, however all libraries and make files should be compatible.
