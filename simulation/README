LModL - Light Modeling Library
A 3D graphics engine and modeling library for rendering point-light.

See COPYING for license information.
See INSTALL for information on compiling.

Library overview:

    3dproj.hpp          3D projection library
    astroconv.h         astronomy conversions
    binfile.hpp         binary file io
    draw8.hpp           8-bit drawing
    drawstar.hpp        star rendering
    sdlwrap.hpp         SDL wrapper functions
    trigtbl.hpp         trigonometric lookup tables

Application overview:

    cubetest.cpp        visual rendering test
    gfxinfo.cpp         graphics resource description
    lightsim.cpp        light simulation animator
    text2bin.c          converts integer/float text files to binary
    fpstest.cpp         test frames-per-second of graphics engine
    trigtblm.cpp        generate table portion of trigtbl.hpp
    mwdemo.cpp          MilkyWay@Home demo app

Note: run application without arguments to for parameter information

Known bugs:

    ***Not all applications are completely up-to-date with their associated libraries
    ***Camera angles still being worked on
    Screen resolution is hard-coded in 'drawstar.h' - the resolution can be changed at compile time.
