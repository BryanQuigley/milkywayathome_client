LModL - Light Modeling Library
A 3D graphics engine and modeling library for rendering point-light.

See COPYING for license information.
See INSTALL for information on compiling.

Library overview:

    3dproj.hpp          3D projection library
    binfile.hpp         binary file io
    draw.hpp            high-level drawing routines
    draw8.hpp           8-bit low-level drawing
    draw24.hpp          24-bit low-level drawing routines
    draw32.hpp          32-bit low-level drawing (24 bits used)
    draw32p.hpp         32-bit low-level drawing (30-bits used)
    drawcore.hpp        primary low-level drawing routines
    drawhalo.hpp        halo field rendering routines
    hlstorgb.hpp        hue/lighting/saturation conversions
    imgplot.hpp         generates halo fields from bmp images
    quatmath.hpp        quaternion ADT
    rgbconv.hpp         color palette routines
    trigtbl.hpp         trigonometric lookup tables / functions
    vectmath.hpp        vector ADT

Application overview:

    coltest.cpp         test 32-bit color
    cubetest.cpp        visual rendering test
    fpstest.cpp         test frames-per-second of graphics engine
    gfxinfo.cpp         graphics resource description
    imgrender.cpp       render specified image
    quattest.cpp        test for quaternion ADT
    text2bin.c          converts integer/float text files to binary
    trigtblm.cpp        generate table portion of trigtbl.hpp

Note: run application without arguments to for parameter information

Known bugs:

    3d line clipping buggy at close range
    3d line draws currently only accurate up to ~1,000,000 units
    in ~1/100 trials, passing just beyond a point and looking back fails setting camera to indeterminate values
